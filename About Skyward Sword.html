<h2>About Skyward Sword.</h2>
<p>  The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is a 2011 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii. <br>
    A high-definition remaster of the game, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, was co-developed by Tantalus Media and released for the Nintendo Switch in July 2021.
    Skyward Sword takes place at the beginning of the Zelda continuity: according to legend, three ancient Goddesses bestowed a great wish-granting power: the Triforce.
    The Demon King Demise, a deity who had conquered time itself, laid waste too much of the land seeking to take the Triforce.
    The Goddess Hylia gathered the survivors and sent them into the sky, allowing her to launch a full-scale offensive against Demise.
    She was victorious, but the land was severely damaged. Uncounted years later, the outcrop is known as Skyloft, and its people believe the surface below is a myth.

<h2> Reasons Why I like Skyward Sword </h2>
<p> Traditional series items such as Bombs used for demolition and the Bow and Arrow for ranged attacks are available as Link progresses through the game,
    along with new additions such as a mechanical Beetle that flies to areas beyond Link's reach for a variety of actions including activating switches,
    and a Whip for grabbing otherwise-unreachable objects and levers. Some items and equipment will degrade and eventually break depending on their use,
    such as the shield taking damage when it fails to block a strike. Items and equipment can be optionally upgraded using materials
    gathered from defeated monsters and within each over-world environment. In addition to consuming resources, Link must also pay for the upgrade with Rupees,
    the game's currency which is randomly scattered throughout the world. This truly is a fun game and my personal record for 100% speed-run is 2:46:34:53, or 2 hours, 46 minutes and almost 35 seconds.
